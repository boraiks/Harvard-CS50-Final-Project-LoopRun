# More Details:
The project uses Flask, python, HTML , CSS, Javascript and SQL. Flask is in with python which i defined the functions like index for main page, update_score to update score with taking the score from scoreSpan which is in the index.html and scoreSpan starts at space keystroke and ends with collision between player and box. After stoping the scoreSpan or counter it returns to python side of my project. And in my sql side i update user's best run as score. I also defined login fucntion, register function and change password function as well in my python side.
