# Harvard-CS50-Final-Project-LoopRun
It is an enjoyable simple game that incorporates Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. Following each successful attempt, the player's score is updated in their profile database and on the leaderboard. Every player has the opportunity to view the top performer via leaderboard.

# More Details:
The project employs Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. Flask is integrated with Python, where I have defined functions such as "index" for the main page and "update_score" to update the score by retrieving it from "scoreSpan" in the index.html. The scoring process initiates with a space keystroke and concludes with a collision between the player and the box. Once the scoring process is halted or the counter reaches its limit, the information returns to the Python side of my project.

On the SQL side, I update the user's best run as the score. Additionally, within my Python implementation, I have defined functions like "login," "register," and "change_password" to manage user authentication and account-related functionalities.
